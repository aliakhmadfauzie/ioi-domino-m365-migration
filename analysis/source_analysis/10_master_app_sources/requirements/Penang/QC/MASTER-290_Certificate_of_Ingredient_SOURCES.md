Parent list: `MainDB_QC`
FormCode: `CERTOFINGR`
Child-list recommendation: No child list inferred from parsed field names; confirm during design

Use the single-main-list pattern from DEC-2026-001. Parsed fields are evidence candidates only; final SharePoint internal names and choices require confirmation against Domino XML/DXL or business review.
